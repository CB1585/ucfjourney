<p>I am originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
    I've spent my first two years in the territory before moving all over the U.S. due to my father's employment in the U.S. Military.
    I have lives in Kansas, Texas, Ohio, back to PR, and finally settling here in Florida for the time being.
    Having been exposed to many different environments and cultures all across the nation, I developed an optimistic attitude that continues to motivate me to this day.
    I have high hopes for my future and am intent on pushing myself towards success.
