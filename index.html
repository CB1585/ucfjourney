<div class="theJourney">
<h1>The Journey</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Christopher Barreto. I am a graduate from UCF who studied Digital Media for Web Design.
    I graduated on December 15th 2022 with a 3.3 gpa, and have been furthering my education on new programming languages and differnt software.
    I would like to show you the journey I've made to reach this point of my life.
</p>

<!--Second Paragraph-->
<div class="theBeginning">
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>My journey begins with my graduation from Paul J. Hagerty High School in Oviedo, Florida. As I stood on the stage and was given my diploma, 
    I began thinking about what my next step would be. The major question was... which college would I attend? I had researched all of the universities around Florida, 
    but decided that i wanted to attend one that was local here in my hometown of Oviedo.

<!--Third Paragraph-->
<div class="scc">
<h2>Seminole State</h2>
<p>I chose to attend Seminole State College because it was the closest and most affordable college for me to begin my education.
    Going to SSC was an interesting experience as I had the impression that the quality of my education would reflect the price of tuition,
    but to my surprise I was provided with excellent professors who were quite involved in teaching us students and keeping us focused throughout our courses.
    Having these professors at hand allowed me to advance through my major with little to no difficulty and made my years over there progress quite fast, and before I 
    knew it I had graduated from SSC with my AA Degree and was now on the way to the University of Central Florida.

<h2>University of Central Florida</h2>

  </div>
  
<p>After earning my AA Degree in Digital Media I was finally administered into UCF. My first task was to go to 
    the introduction event at UCF for new students. This was a shocking experience because this was the first time I had stepped foot into 
    a campus the size of a town. It was quite grand and mazelike that I sometimes found myself lost before I even found the parking garage for 
    the attendees. Once I did find it I was then guided to the massive auditorium where we were given a great introduction by the hosts 
    and were shown the different buildings and resources required for some of our majors and student needs. After that we were then brought back into the auditorium 
    to enjoy a well-made lunch and were given all of the books and resources required to help us with our first day of classes, thereby bringing a conclusion to the 
    event.
</p>

<p>After the event I was now ready to tackle the upcoming classes for the Fall Semester 2019 at UCF. Prior to taking these classes,
    I once again had the impression that many of the classes would become too difficult and require far more work than SSC. But to my surprise, 
    doing the work for these classes proved to be quite similar to the amount of effort I provided at SSC. I did not feel the "shock" that many
    first time college goers felt when switching from high-school to a university or for community-college students going to UCF. The classes and 
    workload felt modest and many of the programs provided a great deal of tutoring and academic resources to assist us students with any issues of our
    respected subjects. For me, coding was the main subjects that I would be tackling in order to achieve my goals.

<!--Fifth Paragraph-->
<div class="YearsAtUCF">
<h2>Years at UCF</h2>
<p>My years at UCF had gradually gone by without too much difficulty in finishing my projects and assignments.
    Although I enjoyed many of the classes, I had decided to switch my degree from general Digital Media to Web Design Fundamentals.
    I chose this degree track because I found that I had done better at coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rather than some of the more video game oriented languages, such as Unity.
    Furthermore, I believed that I could show more potential in creating websites and social media applications than I would with other forms of entertainment.

  <div class="Graduation">
    <h2>Graduation</h2>
    <p>Finally, in the Fall of 2022 I had graduated from the University of Central Florida with my Bachelors of Arts in Digital Media for Web Design.
        This was a momentous occasion for me as I have proven not only to everyone, but most importantly to myslef, that I would succeed.
        Now that I have earned this degree I am excited for the future that lays ahead of me and I hope to make a great impact for those who I will soon work and collaberate with to make a better future.
